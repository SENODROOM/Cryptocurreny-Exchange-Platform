# Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform (C++)

A console-based Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform implemented in **C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project simulates the core functionality of a crypto exchange, including order books, wallets, CSV-based market data, and time-based trading simulation.

> 📘 Inspired by real-world exchange mechanics and developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming specialization.
